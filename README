                              The media9 LaTeX Package
                             ==========================

Description:

This package provides an interface to embed interactive Flash (SWF) and
3D objects (Adobe U3D & PRC) as well as video and sound files or streams
in the popular MP4, FLV, MP3 formats into PDF documents with Acrobat-9/X
compatibility. Playback of multimedia files relies on Adobe Flash Player
which supports the efficient H.264 codec for video compression.

This package is based on the RichMedia Annotation, an Adobe addition to
the PDF specification. It replaces the now obsolete `movie15' package.

*
* Note that Adobe Reader for Linux has dropped Flash support since
* version 9.4.2.
*

Supported PDF making workflows are:
  *  pdfLaTeX, LuaLaTeX
  *  (Lua)LaTeX --> dvips --> ps2pdf/Distiller
  *  (Xe)LaTeX --> (x)dvipdfmx

The package was written in the new LaTeX3 syntax.


Requirements:

  *  l3kernel (LaTeX package), version >=2012/07/16
  *  l3packages (LaTeX package), version >=2012/07/16
  *  pdfTeX, version >=1.30
  *  Ghostscript, version >=8.31 or Adobe Distiller for PS to PDF conversion
  *  dvipdfmx, version >=20120420 for DVI to PDF conversion
  *  Adobe Reader, version >=9


Installation:

MiKTeX and TeXLive users should run the package manager for installation.

Otherwise, a manual install into the local TeX-Directory-Structure
(TDS) root directory can be done along the following steps:

1.) Download the TDS compliant package file
http://mirror.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/contrib/media9.tds.zip.

2.) Find the local TDS root directory by running

  kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFLOCAL

on the command line.

3.) Unzip media9.tds.zip into the local TDS root directory previously
found. Depending on the location of this directory, you may need to be
logged in as Root/Administrator.

4.) After installation, update the filename database by running

  texhash

on the command line. Again, Root/Administrator privileges may be required.

For updating the package, repeat the steps given above.
